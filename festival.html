    <h2> Seollal Festival </h2>
    <p> Seollal (설날), the Korean Lunar New Year, is one of the most significant traditional holidays in Korea. 
      It marks the beginning of the lunar calendar year and is usually celebrated in late January or early February. 
      During Seollal, families gather to perform ancestral rites, wear traditional hanbok clothing, play folk games, and enjoy special foods like tteokguk (rice cake soup), 
      which for their beliefs, eating tteokguk on the new year actually adds another year to their 
age, which shows why the korean age system are different than other countries. 
  Example, people who are born in 2003 should've be 22 in 2025, but in Korea, their age will 
be added by one so they will be 23 in Korea.</p>
